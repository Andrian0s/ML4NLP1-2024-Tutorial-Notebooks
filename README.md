Practical Tutorials for the [Machine Learning for Natural Language Processing 1](https://studentservices.uzh.ch/uzh/anonym/vvz/?sap-language=EN&sap-ui-language=EN#/details/2023/003/SM/50941599) Lecture at the University of Zurich for the Fall Semester 2024.

## Overview
In this repository, you will find the notebooks for the tutorials and exercises for the course. The tutorials are designed to help you understand and put into practice the theoretical concepts discussed in the lecture. Tutorials are designed to be interactive, and you are encouraged to experiment with the code and try different variations to understand the concepts better.

## Exercises (will be updated as the course progresses)

### Exercise 01: 

From linear to deep learning models for text classification. In this exercise, you will implement a simple linear model for text classification using the `sklearn` library. You will then extend the model to a deep learning model using the `skorch` library.

See the exercise sheet for more details: [Exercise 01](./exercises/ex01/ex01.pdf)

Exercise 02: Building word embeddings with PyTorch. In this exercise, you will implement a Continuous Bag of Words Model using the `torch` library. See the exercise sheet for more details: [Exercise 01](./exercises/ex01/ex01.pdf)
